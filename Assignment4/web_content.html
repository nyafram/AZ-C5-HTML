                    We pray for his mercy upon our lives. In the area of registration, information 
                    system has been vital and played a great role in reducing time and bringing services
                    at the door steps of customers and clients. The relation of citizenship began in

                    Towards the end of the Renaissance, Citizens 
                    developed new identities of belonging to a state as well as to their local communities, 
                    recognizing such common elements as language, religion and beliefs in what life should be. 
                    Europe including Britain, majority of the population lived in various forms of bondage, 
                    such as indenture.

                    Information Technology (IT) involves the transmission and storage of information especially,
                    the development, installation, implementation and management of computer systems within organizations. 
                    IT is a modern phenomenon that has dramatically changed the daily lives of individuals and businesses 
                    throughout the world. IT is vital to Company operations and leveraging information technology for 
                    business success is a key to organizational performance (Albers, 2012). IT has become a vital and integral

                    states of ancient Greece. Towards the end of the Renaissance, Citizens developed new identities of belonging 
                    to a state as well as to their local <strong>Communities, recognizing such common elements as language, 
                    religion and beliefs in what life should be. In Europe including Britain, majority of the population 
                    lived in various forms of bondage, such as indenture. Fortunately, in France, a free market and mobility of 
                    labour were driving up wages until in 1804, when French Emperor Napoleon introduced identity cards which 
                    was the main ancestor of all modern ID systems. (Martyn Lyons et al., 1994).
                    Mao’s China adopted and implemented Emperor Napoleon’s two restrictions-  preventing workers from changing 
                    jobs without permission and preventing them from moving location. (Victor N. Shaw, 1996)
                    Nevertheless,</strong> <em>the murderous Nazis Census and Identification schemes in Germany played an integral part, not 
                    only in the genocide but also identifying and suppressing political opponents of the Nazis. They created a Work 
                    Book, which in turn created files, recording the entire course of each person’s life, including periods of 
                    unemployment and so-called breaches of work contracts, aiming to identify not only strikers, but also people who 
                    took too many days’ sick leave, changed their job to get better pay or showed ‘disloyalty’ to their trained career.</em> 
                    (Ibid, p. 109). Using employees’ registration file and computer system were far more important to the Nazis than the
                    ID card itself. Information was brought into the new identity register from other existing data registers, such as
                    health, insurance, welfare records, parish records, records of births and deaths.<br><br>
